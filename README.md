**[Team Page](admin/team.md)**

**Project Description:** Our team is working on creating a fully local first online photoshop web application. At the starting page, users have the ability to upload files from their local device, which is saved to local storage, and view, delete, or download past photos they have uploaded/edited. If they choose to edit a photo, users can change the brightness, the rotation, and crop size of the photo selected. From this point, the user is redirected back to the gallery page which allows them to download, view, or delete the edited photo. 

**Motivation/Statement of Purpose:** Sometimes we need something a little different from what our raw photos can provide. Or, our pictures don't look quite right. So, we will create a way to quickly edit it digitally! Downloading a dedicated application for editing pictures can be a drag, but with this local first CRUD web application, you can quickly upload a photo, make the edits you desire with simplicity, and download them to your local device. If you have multiple picutres you need to edit you can view and download them at your convenience in the gallery section of the web app.

**Problem and Solution:** There is no native way to quickly edit photos without opening a heavy app like Adobe Photoshop or ProCreate, this application should solve that issue as it allows usrs to efficiently go to the web app, upload a photo from their local device, make their edits, and download it right away. More importantly, other photo editing applications require cloud based syncing, which can be a problem for individuals with poor internet connections or when they edit sensitive images. A main advantage of our application is that it will be completely local first and nothing will be cloud based.

**CRUD Overview:**
**Create:** You have the ability to create a new edited photo through the editing features of our web app.
**Read:** You read the photos saved in local storage when you display, download, and delete them.
**Update:** You have the ability to both edit new photos and re-edit past photos.
**Delete:** Users have the ability to delete past edited photos within the gallery page.

## Today's Discussion
- **What has been done:**
  - The HTML and CSS has been primarily completed for the home/gallery page.
  - The upload image to local storage functionality is complete.
  - Coding variable consistency was discussed and implemented.
  - Brightness function exploratory code was completed, so it will be easy to implement into the project
  - Added a linter for the code (added rules)
  - Created many ADRs concerning important decisions for the project
  - Created relevant issues to signify the problem we needed to solve or solution we needed to come up with
  - Linked pull requests with their issues accordingly
  - Unit testing on the CI side is ready to go
  - Requesting reviews on pull requests is enabled
  - Created relevant branches; as a precautionary measure we created a branch called "develop" where we currently push all our main changes to (once this branch  contains our working project, after reveiw, we will add it to the main branch)
  - Had a code review before merging it with the "develop" branch
  - Added documentation to the upload function
- **What needs to be done:**
  - Creating unit tests for Javascript functions - for upload, display, and brightness functions(potentially more if we implement stretch features)
  - Creating the edit page with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
  - Implementing the brightness function from the exploratory code
  - Discussing/Applying the fixes generated by the linter
  - Adding stretch features (focusing on rotate as of right now)
  - Creating the display/view function, so the images in local storage are displayed in the home/gallery page
  - Get image from local storage and display it when editing
- **Things to improve on:**
  - Consistency within the code to avoid linter errors
  - Use Github issues more often
  - Try to write the unit test right after finishing the function
  - Enforce roles/tasks better - make sure everyone is assigned something and is working actively on it (front-end/back-end people work with each other more often)

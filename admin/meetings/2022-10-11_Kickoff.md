## Role Expectations
* Developers - 
 1. Write quality and readable code. 
 2. Write documentation as you code, so everyone knows and understands the functionality.
 3. Collaborate heavily with your fellow developers so everyone is on the same page.
 4. Don't be afraid to ask for help, it's better than writing unusuable code or being stuck on a bug for countless hours.
 5. Focus on a few strong functional components, rather than many slightly functional components.
 6. Be self-motivated. 
* Designers - 
 1. Feel free to ask the non-design team about decisions.
 2. Keep the theme consistent with the entire application.
 3. Remember to consider all types of users.
* QA -
 1. Follow the steps "Plan, Do, Check, and Act"
 2. Don't depend on the developers to ask you to test something.
 3. Update everyone when a change needs to be made, not just the one who is going to make the revision.

  - Needs to mention how every feature is local first and applies to all devices
  - Doesn't mean full in depth details but we should have a plan of how we are going to do it
  - There is a list of things we need to include that Shubham will share with us
- After pitch document (Shubham's suggestions)
  - Part of the team start to use github actions, play around to set up test cases.
  - Some can start designing features and create backlog of things to implement and how to implement them
  - Don't implement until we are done planning
  - backlog is a list of tasks we can assign to people to implement. Do this is we finish planning and designing all the features. Then break it down into smaller tasks and assign

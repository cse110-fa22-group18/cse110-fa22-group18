## Today's Discussion
- Feasibility of ideas
  - Sudoku: difficult to make it a CRUD app; could add a leaderboard with score upload/delete features
  - Notetaking app: likely the easiest to implement; include features such as font, color, highlight, etc.
  - Calendar event app: easy to make a calendar template; trouble when dealing with overlapping events
  - Photoshop app: start off with basic features like import, upload, cropping, black pen drawing
- Project pitch

  - Pitch doc: Google slides

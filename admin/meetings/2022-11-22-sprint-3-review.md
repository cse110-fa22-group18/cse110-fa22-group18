  - created a wireframe for the edit page

  - created the display images in gallery function
  - implemented the user selection feature through window prompts which appear when users click an image in the gallery
  - created a download, edit redirect, and delete function

- **What needs to be done:**

  - we need to create unit tests, which are very difficult to make
  - we need to make a save function that saves the edited image

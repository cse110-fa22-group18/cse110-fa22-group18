## Time and Place
**Time:** 9:00PM to 10:50PM
<br/>
**Location:** Online via Discord
  
## Today's Discussion
- **Things to improve on:**
  - Focus on better communication within front-end and back-end devs
  - Need to write unit tests asap
  - Clarify roles and their expectations a little better
  - Clarify that every members should respond on slack
  - Do better on meeting attendance
- **From Retrium:**
  - **Mad:**
    - Not as much time spend together productively as front end
    - People need to check/reply slack more
    - Can't get a time window works for everyone
    - Getting everyone to the meeting is a drag (mainly because there is 10 people per group)
    - Unorganized meeting today (only one so far)
    - A bit chaos
    - Today's meeting is inefficient. Maybe we can have a simple plan before each meeting and follow it (we usually do, just an exception for this meeting because of very busy schedules)
    - Lots of time spent waiting for others to complete their tasks
    - Everyone's role is still not clear. Maybe we can write about what everyone has done and what will do in next week to have a more efficient plan.
  - **Sad:**
    - Didn't get time to do much this week, gonna be working on our project this weekend
    - Week was pretty busy so didn't have that much time coding
    - Need to distribute work more evenly
    - Not everyone attended
  - **Glad:**
    - Front end helped each other on harder parts, very supportive
    - We have a lot of progress on the front end and upload/gallery feature
    - I'm really liking how the gallery page has turned out
    - Manny is a really great team lead, and we finished a lot so far
    - Many of us agreed on where we have been doing good and where we need to improve
    - Got a lot done with our insanely busy schedules
    - Team leader clutch and continuing good progress

## Action Items

- Ensure good communication for front-end and back-end devs
- Clarify that you must reply on stack and make sure people prioritize meetings for this class
- Have a meeting tomorrow to clarify roles and assign them accordingly.

## Today's Discussion
- **Things to improve on:**
  - Focus up on the unit tests and finish them up
  - Make sure theam is well organized in roles for the final weeks to come
  - Deal with 5mb cap on the local storage using either index.db or an image compression function
  - remove unnecessary branches that are not being used
  - ensure that the edit page works with brightness and rotate
  - ensure that the save button saves the image after editing
- **From Retrium:**
  - **What Went Well?**: 
    - good progress on edit page design, as well as integrating edit and gallery
    - focused, more productive without tests etc.
    - we were a lot more structured in front-end and back-end
    - nice process!
    - everyone is doing a great job in ensuring the completion of the project
    - great communication among team members within backend and frontend
    - good communication with team members
    - Can rely on the team :)
    - clearer goals and tasks
    - good job identifying that we can't use local storage this early in the development - good job manual testing
    - update video in on time and it had substance
    - Unit and end2end tests are being implemented
    - Gallery page is done
    - Edit page is just about done
    - Having the whole website actually working rn 
    - Lots of progress got done, web app is nearing completion
    - Basic functionalities are reaching completion
  - **What Didn't Go Well?:**
    - We have a lot of branches that we need to remove
    - There have become mnay branches and it is hard to keep track of which branch contains what progress
    - Need to improve GitHub mangement. It's hard to find the newest update
    - still a little hazy on the roles
    - not equal distribution of tasks
    - not everyone was involved
    - Dumb local storage has a 5mb cap forcing us to either use index.db or create an image compression function
    - encountered issues with storage limits with localStorage
    - creating unit tests
    - testing is a pain
    - we need more people writing unit tests for the code that they write

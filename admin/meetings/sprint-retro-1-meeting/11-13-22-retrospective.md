## Time and Place
**Time:** 10:50AM - 12PM
<br/>
**Location:** Online via Discord
  
## Today's Discussion
- **Things to improve on:**
  - Consistency within the code to avoid linter errors
  - Use Github issues more often
  - Try to write the unit test right after finishing the function
  - Enforce roles/tasks better - make sure everyone is assigned something and is working actively on it (front-end/back-end people work with each other more often)
- **From Retrium:**
  - **What went well?:**
    - Managed to get the website foundation down and begin features
    - Got a good foundation for the project going
    - Got a fair amount of the project done in a reasonable amount of time
    - The webpage is going well and looks good
    - We did well on the upload page, upload function, brightness function, ci test, branches, GitHub action and workflow
    - Backend functionality is being developed at a steady pace
    - Formalize everything, styling and GitHub stuffs. Build the basics for our web app
    - We established a good work process on github
    - Mob coding sessions went well, but might want to consider pair programming or using vscode's extension
    - Very efficient with our meetings, met guidelines from outline
  - **What didn't go well?:**
    - Enforce roles and tasks better
    - Maybe we need to assign everyone's tasks more clearly and start to do the edit page
    - We could talk more than just twice a week
    - Need a little more communication amongts back-end and front-end individuals
    - Communicate/have more collaboration with people doing the same features
    - Better communication within teams
    - Online meetings turned out less efficient. Road map needs to be updated along the way
    - Branch structure seems a bit necessary/too many branches this early on
    - Probably be more consistent with styling

## Action Items

- Front-end devs will remain consistent with their html and css
- Fix branch structure by minimizing it to a few
- Pair programming might be a good idea or using Vscode's extension for collab coding
- Write unit tests right after making the JS function
- Use Github issues more often
- Code consistently to ensure there are less linter errors
- Have another team meeting to discuss and clarify team roles and expectations
- If schedules allow, have more meetings during the week
- Maintain the pace of the web app development

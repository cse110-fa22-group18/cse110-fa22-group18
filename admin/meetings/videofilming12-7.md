## Retro - Nathan
challenges you faced, what things you felt you overcame and anything you feel you would do differently now that you are done
 - Nathan - Don't wait too long to PR - creates a lot of merge conflicts because the parent branch is far ahead of the feature branch.
    Also waiting longer means more code to review.
 - Nathan - More foresight in backend design - more classes, more functions, more modular. In our code, our actual scripts were longer than expected and
    more modular code could have been easier to read, edit, and test. This made it a little difficult to change the code from localStorage to indexedDB
    , classes and functions in module files could have made it easier.
 - Hariz - Task Breakdown - Better communication on who is doing what and what their deadlines are. We got the hang of it later on but in the beginning
    we lacked direction and peopled didn't always know what to work on. It got better as we started to use github issues more. We need to divide tasks into
    more bite sized chunks.
  - Hariz - More communication of changes that can affect others - notes in PR, messages in slack. As we started making more frequent PRs, people better 
    communicated chagnes that could affect others. 
    
   
## Advice to Future 110 
 - Ira - Keep the scope really small at first. Even though we thought that our project had a small scope, we ended up cutting 2 features we thought originally. 
 - Mandeep - Make time for testing, and plan code freeze way ahead of time.

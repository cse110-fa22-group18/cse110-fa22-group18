# Communication Expectations

We will be primarily communicating through Slack, Zoom, and Email. All team members are required to answer any and all relevant messages within the day it is sent. During meetings, each member must respectfully and actively listen to others, while also providing effective and appropriate ideas. If you feel like something is wrong, tell the group or team member in a respectful way.

# Meeting Scheduling

Team meetings will be scheduled according to the when2meet posted each week, which could possibly be discussed on Slack. In the event that there is no time slot where everyone is free, prepare to open up your schedule where you can, as every meeting for this class is very important and must be attended. If you miss a meeting, you are responsible for catching up on what happened in the meeting through the team leads and the corresponding meeting minutes.

# General Responsibilities and Expectations

- Meetings
  - Be flexible with your schedule and attend every meeeting you can
  - Respect the time of others by arriving on time so the meeting may end on time as well
  - Provide updates on your current status and report issues you have encountered or foresee
  - If you are unable to attend a meeting, get up to speed by contacting team members or reading through the meeting notes

- Communication
  - Post your daily standups on Slack (weekdays 11 am)
  - Be attentive to what others say and don't interrupt others
  - Add your own ideas to a dicussion and start a discussion yourself if necessary
  - Think actively and build upon the ideas of others
  - If you need help, reach out and ask for assistance from teammates

- Professionalism
  - Be cordial and courteous
  - Be open to learning new tools and methods
  - Aim for productive discourse and promote mutual respect
  - Step up to the task when you feel it suits you but also don't be afraid to take risks
  - Own up to mistakes instead of blaming others
  - Stay on top of work to avoid last minute crams

# Conflict Resolution Policy

Conflicts will be dealt with accordingly in a hierarchical structure. In the event that a problem arises with a teammate or various teammates, first report it to the team leads so they can properly take care of the problem. If that does not work, we discuss the problem with the whole team and try to resolve the conflict from there. If that still doesn't work we take the problem to our TA guide Shubham, who will address the issue accordingly. In the worst case, we take the problem to Professor Powell who will make the ultimate decision in providing us with a conflict resolution. Please note that when a reportable issue does occur, analyze it and make sure it is truly an issue that needs to be brought up for resolution. Maintain respect and honesty throughout the whole process of conflict resolution. As a team it is absolutely crucial that we preserve our strong relationship with each other to better collaborate on the project at hand.

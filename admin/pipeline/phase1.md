# Status: Barely Functional
### Planned Features
- Linting to properly format JS using ESLint (maybe)
- Code quality checking using CodeCimate (maybe)
- Unit tests for every JS function using Jest
- Automated documentation using JSDocs

### Current Features
- Dummy Jest unit test
- Pull review request

### Current Process
When a commit or pull request is made to main:
1. Check all unit tests
	* sum.js
		* sum(1+2) = 3
2. Have a code review request made to any pull request
	* Since this is a private repository, no review requests are made

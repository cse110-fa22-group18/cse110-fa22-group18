**Name:** Mandeep Chera

**Overview:** I am a 4th year Computer Science major who has a keen interest in machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and software development. I am proficient in the programming languages of Python, C++, and Java, as most of my projects were made through these. I am also sufficiently familiar with the languages of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In respect to my work ethic, I try my best to complete my work thoroughly, effectively, and efficiently. I am taking CSE 110 in an effort to learn and master software engineering practices to one day apply to my future career.

**Name:** Mandeep Chera

**Overview:** I am a 4th year Computer Science major who has a keen interest in machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and software development. I am proficient in the programming languages of Python, C++, and Java, as most of my projects were made through these. I am also sufficiently familiar with the languages of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In respect to my work ethic, I try my best to complete my work thoroughly, effectively, and efficiently. I am taking CSE 110 in an effort to learn and master software engineering practices to one day apply to my future career.

**Name:** Ira Hanabusa

**Overview:** Hello! I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering major at ERC. I enjoy the outdoors and playing videogames both solo and with friends. I have primarily used Java, C, and C++ up to this point. I don't have much webdev experience besides making a simple website in highschool, but I hope to get used all sorts of tools throughout this course.

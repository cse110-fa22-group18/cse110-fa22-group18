# Decision/Choice

## Context and Problem Statement
Crop could be a potential rabbit hole in its complexity. Should we move this feature to be a stretch feature?

## Decision Drivers
- We need to implement basic features. 
- We want to minimize complexity within features.
- We want to maximize application functionality.

## Considered Options
- Keep crop as a core feature
- Keep crop as a stretch feature

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option and reason: We chose to keep crop as a stretch feature as its complexity could take longer than the time we have. We decided as a team to focus on the features that are more attainable with the time we have.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
- Allows us to focus on attainable core features
- Reduces risk of not finishing the feature

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
- Risk of not finishing the feature because of its complexity in implementation
- Risk of not getting to this feature

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Keep crop as a core feature
General Description <!-- optional -->
- Good, because it is a good feature to have for a photo editing app
- Bad, because it poses a risk of not finishing the feature because of its complexity
- Bad, because it could take longer than the time we have

### Keep crop as a stretch feature
General Description <!-- optional -->
- Good, because it allows us to focus on other main features
- Good, because it will reduce the risk of not finishing the feature
- Good, because it follows the professor's want of less features and more focus on SE principles
- Bad, because there will be less features

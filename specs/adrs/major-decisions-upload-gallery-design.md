# Decision/Choice
- Status: Accepted
- Deciders: Whole Team
- Date: 11/25/22

## Context and Problem Statement
How should we store user created content and preferences? Specifically, how should user and community recipes be stored and served?

## Decision Drivers
- We need to implement the gallery, edit page
- We want to minimize complexity
- We want to maximize functionality of core features

## Considered Options
- Scroll gallery, fixed grid gallery, and wrapping auto resizing gallery
- Edit page with features bar or drop down

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option and reason: Wrapping gallery with auto resizing so it is still easy to choose an image and it is able to use the drop down. 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
- Wrapping gallery allows us to use drop down, easy to list options
- Edit page can fit all features, so features bar is easy to make and it looks better

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
- Drop down doesn't look as nice, and grid can be more organized than wrapping gallery
-feature bar is harder to implement and fill with icons

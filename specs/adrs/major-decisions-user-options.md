# Decision/Choice
- Status: accepted  
- Deciders: the whole team
- Date: 11/19/2022

## Context and Problem Statement
How should the user edit, delete, or download and image? Specifically how should the user view these options?

## Decision Drivers
- We need to implement a way for users to view gallery image options
- We want to minimize errors and time.
- We want to maximize efficiency in implementation.

## Considered Options
- Dropdown menu using HTML and CSS
- Window prompts using JS

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option and reason: Window prompts were the best decision due to our time constraint for the class. Research into connecting the dropdown menu to each image showed that it would take a lot longer to implement then originally expected. Using Window prompts will maximize efficiency.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
- Efficiency is maximized
- Easy to understand

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
- Takes a lot of work and time we do not have
- Could lead to many errors

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Dropdown menu
General Description <!-- optional -->
- Good, because it looks aesthetically pleasing
- Good, because it would look like modern websites
- Bad, because it would take way too much time
- Bad, because it is too complicated for the time we got

### Window Prompt
General Description <!-- optional -->
- Good, because it is simple to implement
- Good, because it is far more efficient than a dropdown menu
- Bad, because it isn't exactly aesthetically pleasing
